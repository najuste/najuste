## Hi there, I am Justina ðŸ‘‹ 
**Based in Berlin, from Lituania, working remotelly as a Web Developer!**

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m still growing into this carrer as I am a career switcher and I am also a mum.

ðŸ”§ Iâ€™m currently working on mastering Javascript and Typescript and learning Python for the Backend.

ðŸ”­ I'm searching the ways to grow into a teacher/speaker/mentor/couch.

âš¡ Fun facts: I can juggle, I sing Lithuanian folklore and I am managing the informal lithuanina (Pre)School In Berlin for kids.
